# IncrementalInference.jl
Optimization routines for incremental non-parametric and parametric solutions based on factor graphs and the Bayes (Junction) tree.

Introduction
------------

This work is an extension of the iSAM2 [1] work towards hybrid non-parametric [2] and parametric inference techniques. Inference is perfomed from a graphical model standpoint, where non-parametric and parametric solutions are based on belief propagation -- also known as the sum-product algorithm.
